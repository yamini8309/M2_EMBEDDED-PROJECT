  
The project PASSWORD PROTECTED GSM BASED DEVICE CONTROL is
an exclusive project which allows the user to control the electrical loads in homes or offices just
by sending predefined messages to the controlling system. This project is designed in such a way
that a GSM modem is interfaced to the controller through serial port interface. The AC
devices/loads which are to be controlled by using GSM will be interfaced to the controller
through the relays. The GSM modem performs the task of receiving the message from the mobile
and sending the messages to the mobile from the controlling unit. Each electrical device or load
will be provided with a unique password. These electrical appliances can be operated only if the
correct password is sent to the device through controlling unit using GSM technology. If the user
wishes to control the devices ON/OFF in industries or homes, he has to send correct password to
the modem from his mobile. The GSM modem receives this message and intimates the same to
the microcontroller. Now it is the job of the controller to switch ON/OFF the corresponding
devices in accordance with the received password.
